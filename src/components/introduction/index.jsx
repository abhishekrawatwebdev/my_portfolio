        <p>
            I am a tech enthusiast, foodie, loves to 
            draw portraits <br /> and a sports enthusiast.
            Professionally I am a front-end developer <br />
            and learning backend technologies.
            I'm quiet confident, and working <br />
            on improving my development techniques
            and also a little bit on designing. <br /> I'm a self
            learner who is motivated by daily challenges
            and has<br /> been looking forward to innovate.
